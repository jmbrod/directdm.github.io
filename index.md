**DirectDM**: a tool for dark matter direct detection
=========

`DirectDM` is a program that matches Wilson coefficients of a relativistic EFT onto a Galilean-invariant non-relativistic EFT
valid at the nuclear scale. The program is available both as a `Mathematica` and a `python` package.


The `Mathematica` package is available from: [github.com/DirectDM/directdm-mma](https://github.com/DirectDM/directdm-mma)

The `python` package is available from: [github.com/DirectDM/directdm-py](https://github.com/DirectDM/directdm-py)
